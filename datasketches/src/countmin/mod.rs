//! Count-Min sketch implementation for frequency estimation.
//!
//! The Count-Min sketch provides approximate frequency counts for streaming data
//! with configurable relative error and confidence bounds.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use datasketches::countmin::CountMinSketch;
//! let mut sketch = CountMinSketch::<i64>::new(5, 256);
//! sketch.update("apple");
//! sketch.update_with_weight("banana", 3);
//! assert!(sketch.estimate("banana") >= 3);
//! ```
//!
//! # Configuration Helpers
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use datasketches::countmin::CountMinSketch;
//! let buckets = CountMinSketch::<i64>::suggest_num_buckets(0.01);
//! let hashes = CountMinSketch::<i64>::suggest_num_hashes(0.99);
//! let _sketch = CountMinSketch::<i64>::new(hashes, buckets);
//! ```
