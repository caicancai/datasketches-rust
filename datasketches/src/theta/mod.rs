//! Theta sketch implementation for cardinality estimation.
//!
//! Theta sketch is a generalization of the Kth Minimum Value (KMV) sketch that uses
//! a hash table to store retained entries and a theta parameter (sampling threshold)
//! to control memory usage. When the hash table reaches capacity, theta is reduced
//! to maintain the nominal size k.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Theta sketches provide approximate distinct count (cardinality) estimation with
//! configurable accuracy and memory usage. The implementation supports:
//!
//! - **ThetaSketch**: Mutable sketch for building from input data
